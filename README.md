# SoundCloud-Sync

With this app you can easily synchronize likes, folowings and playlists between two SoundCloud accounts. I love SoundCloud, and this app was made just for fun, with the intention to learn new things, try out new concepts and to explore the SoundCloud API.

The App is built with Electron and Quasar. Currently the registration of new apps for SoundCloud API is disabled. And the API-v1 seems to be slowly shut down (that's sad). So the app uses an uncomfortable workaround for user authentication and the app relies on non-public API-v2. No one should ever use this app.
